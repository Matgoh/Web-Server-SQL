# Database Table Summary:

The tables that we have created are the player's names, time alive, high score,  
They are related by each player individually having a name, time alive, and score. 

# Extent of work:

1. We were with decent time able to get the web server up and running that when connected to through a browser would return a basic welcome page. 
2. On the webpage, there is a link that if one were to select it would take them to a chart of highscores.
3. Our page allows requests to store highscores, though it may not actually store the correct information.
4. The page also allows the user to select the reload link to reload the page, and there is a counter that counts how many times one reloads the page. 
5. We did not have enough time for our client code to contact the database that we created to store more information.

# Partnership Information:

Matthew and Alex worked through this assignment mainly through zoom as our schedules did not line up super well to meet in person and dual code. 
Alex navigated resources into this assignment to help Matthew drive our ideas of how to do this assignment in such short time into a somewhat complete assignment. More specifically, the ideas with how to create our database plus the six tables in which we filled with our own information, the webserver mainpage to get the server running, and the READMEs. Matthew drove most of the code, specifically getting the webserver to connect to the localhost, having links pop up such as reload and highscores, use his database for the partnership (since Alex's was never fixed), send information to the database, and create a secrets file. 

# Branching:

Two branches were created besides the main branch, and that was for parallel work to not mess with each other's work while we worked together. The merge process this time was surprisingly smooth with little issues, because we were way more aware with the potential issues that non-branching would create. 

# Testing: 

We tested our code by repeatedly running the web server and superficially testing by clicking the links and ensuring that it takes us to the intended screen. 

# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Nine:   Predicted Hours: 30    Actual Hours: 20+  
 
We feel like our estimates in time spent aren't getting better. Even though we were far off with our initial estimate of the assignment, this would be due to how broad and tricky we felt like this assignment was. We were told to create a database in a new software as well as connect everything to html and code in Visual Studio without any previous background knowledge, so starting it off was a huge time expenditure.
