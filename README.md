# Overview of the Solution functionality


# External Code Resources:


# Partnership:

While a lot of our code was done via partner programming, there were sections where we each individually did our work to the best of our ability.



# Problems:


# Branching:

Only one branch was created besides the main branch, and that was for parallel work as we were afraid that working in the same branch would mess up the code.

# Testing: 


# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Nine:   Predicted Hours: 30    Actual Hours: 20+
